<p>To create this website, I studied how Bootstrap works to streamline the development process. </p>
<p>I want to note that, aside from the content, I did everything myself.</p>
<p>Most of the time was spent not on coding, but on learning how various elements function.</p>
<p>Additionally, I turned to ChatGPT in certain moments when I couldn't solve a particular issue on my own.</p>
